It contains the following public variables: Int_t Mat Material Index (default: 1) Silicon: 0 Poly Silicon: 1 Silicon Oxide: 2 Diamond: 10 Air: 20 Aluminum: 100 Float_t Temperature Temperature in Kelvin (default: 293) Mobility Mobility Model (default: 1) Canali: 1 Scharf: 3 Jacoboni: 4 Int_t ImpactIonization Impact Ionization Coefficient (default: 0) Perm The function Float_t Perm(Int_t Material) determines the relative permeability \\(\\epsilon_r\\) of the material depending on the value of Mat. MobMod The function Int_t MobMod determines the mode of mobility depending on Mat and Mobility. Note that Mobility is only taken into account if the material is silicon. dEX The function Float_t dEX(Double_t E, Double_t *x, Double_t *y, Double_t eps) is not used by anything else. dEdx The function Float_t dEDx(Double_t E) is not used by anything else.","title":"KMaterial"},{"location":"KMaterial/#kmaterial","text":"This page contains functions and the KMaterial class that describes the properties of various materials.","title":"KMaterial"},{"location":"KMaterial/#functions","text":"Refer to this for background information.
